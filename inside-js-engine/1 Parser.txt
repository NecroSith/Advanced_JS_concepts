JS engine consists of several components through which data is passed
JS Engine V8 is writen in C++

1) JS code is passed to PARSER
Parser does lexical analysis
It splits the JS code into tokens to identify what's happening there

e.g. 
var big = 325;
using split(' ') method can be deconstructed to 
['var', 'big', '=', '325']

2) This tokens are then passed to AST
ABSTRACT SYNTAX TREE

It creates tree like structure where everything in the code is written one by one
all operations, declarations, everything
AST trees can be explored in
