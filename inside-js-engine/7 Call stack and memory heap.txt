Call stack
A place where js engine keeps track of where your code is in execution
it works based on "First In, Last Out" mode.
It stores functions and variables as the code executes
Consists of stack frames


function calculate() {
    return 4 + 5;
}

calculate() 
Here when calculate is called it's placed on top of the call stack
after function is executed it's removed from the stack

Memory heap
A place in memory to store all variables and al the data of the executing code
Where all allocation happens

const num = 66; 
Here we tell js engine to alocate some memory for a num variable
Which will be pointing to the place in memory that stores 66
