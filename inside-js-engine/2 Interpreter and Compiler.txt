3) After AST the code goes to INTERPRETER

Interpreter translates the input code line by line on the fly

4) Compiler unlike interpreter doesn't do translating on the fly
Instead, it analyses the input code and creates the same functionality in bytecode
Which then is processed to create machine code which goes to CPU
